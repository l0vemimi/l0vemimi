Baby developer. I also have adhd so my repos are usually littered with ✨ unfinished projects. ✨

Current skills: Front end web dev ~ JS, CSS, HTML; Python; Shell scripting. (I use the word 'skills' very lightly because I am by no means an expert or anywhere close to being one for a while lol).

Also I use arch linux :godmode: (btw), not that it's relevant but thought anyone reading this deserves to know.

#### Current Projects:

🚧 | 📓 [tigerdb](https://github.com/l0vemimi/tigerdb): Docs database and repository for all things ops; devops; cybersec; red&blue teaming.

🚧 | 📓 [arch-btw](https://github.com/l0vemimi/arch-btw): Docs database repository for [archlinux](https://archlinux.org/); I plan to add an install wiki, list of packages sorted by use case, man pages and general "how-to's" for linux.

🚧 | 🎮 [GlowieInTheDark](https://github.com/l0vemimi/GlowieInTheDark) [JS/PHASER]: Silly and useless game in honour of the one and only [King Terry Davis](https://youtu.be/moAFmM_XYJI?feature=shared). I plan to add a sound track, more UI development, environment mappings and more. Current state is bare bones. 

🚧 | 🎮 [ow](https://github.com/l0vemimi/ow) [PY/PYGAME]: OW or *Open World* Another silly unfinished game; I've only just built the base concept. I plan to add actual maps; character creation; and just general logic. It will be a single player open world game similar to [animal crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing). 

#### Future Projects:

Just like every other baby dev, I've got dreams and aspirations far beyond by capabilities. Below is a list of projects I'd like to create in the future.

💡 | 💻 **Android OS:** Free open source android operating system with NO telemetry; user focused; Centered around privacy; Freedom for autonomous control.

💡 | 💻 **Kernel:** Multiplatformed linux kernel with capabilities to run both on android and desktop, all with shared libaries making sysadmin ops a lot easier.

💡 | 💻 **Linux distro:** 99.99% most likely will be arch based because that's what I'm comfortable with.

💡 | 🎮 **Open world game:** Multiplayer open world game similar to [RuneScape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape) or [club penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin); not to put them in the same category lol but a similar style to them.
