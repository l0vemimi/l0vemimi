Baby developer. I also have adhd so my repos are usually littered with ✨ unfinished projects. ✨

#### Current skills: Front end web dev ~ 
- JS CSS, HTML
- Python
- Shell scripting

I use the word 'skills' very lightly because I am by no means an expert or anywhere close to being one for a while lol.

Also I use arch linux :godmode: (btw), not that it's relevant but thought anyone reading this deserves to know.

#### Current Projects:

🚧 | 📓 [tigerdb](https://github.com/l0vemimi/tigerdb): Docs database and repository for all things ops; devops; cybersec; red&blue teaming.

🚧 | 📓 [arch-btw](https://github.com/l0vemimi/arch-btw): Docs database repository for [archlinux](https://archlinux.org/); I plan to add an install wiki, list of packages sorted by use case, man pages and general "how-to's" for linux.

🚧 | 🎮 [GlowieInTheDark](https://github.com/l0vemimi/GlowieInTheDark) [JS/PHASER]: Silly and useless game in honour of the one and only [King Terry Davis](https://youtu.be/moAFmM_XYJI?feature=shared). I plan to add a sound track, more UI development, environment mappings and more. Current state is bare bones. 

🚧 | 🎮 [ow](https://github.com/l0vemimi/ow) [PY/PYGAME]: OW or *Open World* Another silly unfinished game; I've only just built the base concept. I plan to add actual maps; character creation; and just general logic. It will be a single player open world game similar to [animal crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing). 

#### Future Projects:

Just like every other baby dev, I've got dreams and aspirations far beyond my capabilities. Below is a list of projects I'd like to create in the future.

💡 | 💻 **Android OS:** Free open source android operating system with NO telemetry; user focused; Centered around privacy; Freedom for autonomous control.

💡 | 💻 **Kernel:** Multiplatformed linux kernel with capabilities to run both on android and desktop, all with shared libaries making sysadmin ops a lot easier.

💡 | 💻 **Linux distro:** 99.99% most likely will be arch based because that's what I'm comfortable with.

💡 | 🎮 **Open world game:** Multiplayer open world game similar to [RuneScape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape) or [club penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin); not to put them in the same category lol but a similar style to them.

And now concluding this with some holy wisdom:

*“What’s reality? I don’t know. When my bird was looking at my computer monitor I thought, ‘That bird has no idea what he’s looking at.’ And yet what does the bird do? Does he panic? No, he can’t really panic, he just does the best he can. Is he able to live in a world where he’s so ignorant? Well, he doesn’t really have a choice. The bird is okay even though he doesn’t understand the world. You’re that bird looking at the monitor, and you’re thinking to yourself, ‘I can figure this out.’ Maybe you have some bird ideas. Maybe that’s the best you can do.”*
